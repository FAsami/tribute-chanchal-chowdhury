          <p class="generic-description">
            Chanchal Chowdhury was born and brought up in the village of
            Kamarhaat in Pabna. He was born in Hindu Family.[8] His father's
            name is Radha Gobindo Chowdhury and mother's name is Nomita
            Chowdhury. He passed his SSC examination from Udaypur High School in
            1990 and HSC examination from Rajbari Government College in 1992. He
            came to Dhaka in 1993 to apply for admission in the Department of
            Fine Arts at the University of Dhaka. His parents wanted him to be
            an engineer but an innate urge for art and culture drove him to
            become an actor. Chanchal Chowdhury settled in Dhaka in 1993 and
            dived headfirst into as much culture as possible. As a third year
            student of DU, he joined the theater group Aronnok. He then worked
            on stage for 10 years continuously. During this period, he played
            minor roles in different television dramas as well. His first role
            as a hero was in the drama Grash directed by Faridur Rahman.
            Meanwhile, Chowdhury pursued his profession in UODA as a lecturer of
            Fine Arts from 2001 to 2006

            It was in 2004 that Fazlur Rahman Babu (actor) introduced Chowdhury
            to Gias Uddin Selim and Mostofa Sarwar Farooki. Chowdhury then
            started working more and more in television dramas. His initial
            works are Shurjer Hashi with Gias Uddin Selim, Talpatar Shepai,
            Nikhoj Shogbaad and a TV commercial, Maa with Mostofa Sarwar
            Farooki. At this point Chowdhury's life took an upward surge towards
            success as the commercial gained him immense popularity.
